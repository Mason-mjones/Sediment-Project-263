    "This study aims to investigate the influence of submarine canyon topography on wave dynamics and nearshore currents, with a particular focus on the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. Specifically, the project will assess how local significant wave height is altered by the presence of the canyon and will estimate potential nearshore current velocities at and around the canyon head. These estimates will be used to explore the potential for sediment transport in this region. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we utilize model data from the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP), specifically the Model Output and Processing (MOP) system. CDIP, based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, provides real-time and historical wave data along the U.S. Pacific coast. The MOP model integrates offshore buoy observations with nested numerical wave models, including the SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) model, to generate high-resolution hindcasts and forecasts of wave conditions across coastal transects. This system is capable of resolving how wave energy is transformed as it propagates shoreward, making it particularly effective for analyzing complex coastal features such as submarine canyons, headlands, and reefs. Data for this project will be extracted from CDIP MOP transects located near the head of the Monterey Canyon. This submarine canyon is a dominant bathymetric feature within Monterey Bay and is known to significantly influence local hydrodynamics. Due to its steep and incised structure, the canyon can refract and focus incoming wave energy, potentially altering both wave height and direction in the nearshore zone. Understanding how these modifications affect current speeds and sediment dynamics is crucial for coastal process studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the significant wave height (Hs) data from these transects, we will calculate near-bottom alongshore current velocities employing the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) equation. The CERC equation is a semi-empirical formula used widely in coastal engineering to estimate longshore sediment transport based on wave energy flux. It relates the breaking wave height and angle of incidence to the momentum transfer that drives alongshore currents. By estimating these current velocities, we can make inferences about sediment transport potential in the vicinity of the canyon head. \n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this research lies in its contribution to our understanding of how submarine canyons affect sediment movement and coastal morphology. Sediment transport processes play a critical role in shaping shorelines, maintaining benthic habitats, and supporting biological productivity. In particular, submarine canyons serve as key conduits for material exchange between shallow coastal areas and deeper marine environments. Ultimately, this project seeks to determine whether a correlation exists between significant wave height and calculated near-bottom current velocities in the Monterey Canyon region. Identifying such a relationship could provide valuable insights into sediment transport mechanisms in canyon-influenced coastal systems and improve predictive capabilities for coastal management and conservation planning.
